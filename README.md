# Express.js: Handling Empty or Invalid JSON Request Bodies

This repository demonstrates a common issue when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications: the failure to correctly handle empty or invalid JSON payloads.

## Problem
When an empty or invalid JSON is sent to an Express.js server using `express.json()`, `req.body` will either be `undefined` or contain only a partial payload.  This results in unexpected behavior, potential errors, or application crashes.

## Solution
To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to add error handling and validation steps to your middleware to check the integrity of incoming JSON.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd express-json-handling`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the application: `node bug.js`
5. Send an empty POST request or a POST request with invalid JSON to `/data` using a tool like Postman or curl. Observe the console output and the response.

## Bug Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using middleware to check for and handle such scenarios gracefully.
